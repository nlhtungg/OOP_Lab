Question:  Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Answer: Java is a Pass by Value programming language. In Java, when you pass an argument to a method, you are passing a copy of the value. This means that changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original value.
